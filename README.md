This code attempts to extend the 2D bin-packing heuristic from [AlkiviadisAleiferis's hyperpack package](https://github.com/AlkiviadisAleiferis/hyperpack) to work with 3D boxes.

After working on the project, it is clear to me why 3D bin packing solvers are not always the most efficient -- there are so many ways that items can be arranged in a container that searching for better ones is not always worth it (at least without more complex methods like genetic algorithms). I've tested a variety of 3D bin packing heuristics while I worked on this project, and I can't say that any were significantly better than the others using the hyperpack's metaheuristic strategy.

As of right now, though, the program does work well for relatively few items where items do not have irregularly long/small sizes. If you'd like to test it out, run ```tests/test3D.py```.
